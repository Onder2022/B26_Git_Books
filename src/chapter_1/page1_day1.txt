This is the start of my book

Git and GitHub

Git: a version control system

GitHub: A platform to host remote repositories

Local repository: Folder to keep track of changes locally, on each device

Remote repositories: Folder online that keeps track of changes but also can have changes of others

Un-versioned: Not being kept track of

Push: Sending the changes in the local repository to the remote repository
